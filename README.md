#	Summary
Face-It allows the users to upload (provide an URL to) a human face image for analysis. The app returns information about the person based purely on the facial features analyzed from this image. A beauty score is also calculated for reference. The user can then upload (provide a URL to) another human face image for the same analysis and comparison. The two images of human faces are compared for similarities and an alikeness score is calculated for reference. Face-It is designed to provide human face analysis and comparison between different people, age, mood, style, cosmetics, plastic surgery, etc. and also to find similarities between family members, look-alikes, twins, etc.    

#	Technology
